<h3>Time For Some Sloth Facts!</h3>
<br />
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ancient Sloths:</strong>
        <p>While modern sloths are around the size of a medium-sized dog, the ancient relatives of sloths aka Megatherium sloths could grow as large as an Asian elephant! These massive beasts became extict around 10,000 years ago.</p>

    </li>

    <br />

    <li><strong>Just Hanging:</strong>
        <p>Sloths are able to hang upside down for 90% of their livespan because of their organs being attached to their lungs allowing them to still breathe while hanging for so long.</p>

    </li>

    <br />

    <li><strong>Slow Digestion:</strong>
        <p>Sloths mainly eat buds, leaves, and tender shoots. They have a multi-compartment stomach that allows them to digest tough cellulose foods that they eat, but it is a slow proccess for them, taking about 30 days to digest one leaf! Talk about sticking with the theme.</p>

    <br />

    <li><strong>Sloth or Owl?:</strong>
        <p>Sloths have extra vertebrae at the base of their neck which allows them to turn their head on a 270 degree axis. They can almost see 360 degrees around their surroundings allowing them to watch for any danger.</p>

    </li>

    <br />

    <li><strong>Water Skills:</strong>
        <p>While sloths are known for being very slow on land, they are impressive in the water. They are able to move three times faster when they swim and they can also hold their breath for up to 40 minutes, surpressing their metabolism to make their heart rate a third of its average speed.</p>

    <br />

    <li><strong>Beauty Rest:</strong>
        <p>Growing up I always thought sloths slept for most of the day, but come to find out they actually only sleep for about as long as humans do! 8-9 hours a day.</p>

    <br />

    <li><strong>Tree Huggers:</strong>
        <p>When sloths need to go number 1 or 2, they slide down to the base of a tree and hold on for dear life as they do their duties! Call me weird, but I find them looking extra cute when in this position lol.</p>
